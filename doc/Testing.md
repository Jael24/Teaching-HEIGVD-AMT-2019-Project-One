# Testing

## Model tests

We have create a class of tests for every class of model. In these test classes, we test every methods (e.g. Getters, Constructors and Builders).

## Integration tests

We have create integration tests for multiple DAO. These tests are run with Arquillian. In these classes, we test CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete).
