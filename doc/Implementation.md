# Implementation
- We followed the MVC model for the data model entities.
- The model part consist of the classes movie, actor and character.
- The view part is made of all the jsp files.
- The controller part consist of every servlet classes.
- We used DAO to bind the different parts of the model.
- We used DAOs to execute queries on the database using the overridden `doPost` and `doGet` method
- We separated the classes using packages that represent the different tiers of a multi-tiered application.
