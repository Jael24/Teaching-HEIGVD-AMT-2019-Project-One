# Teaching-HEIGVD-AMT-2019-Project-One
## Introduction
This application has been created for the course of AMT in 2019. This multi-tiered application uses Java EE in order to represent a simple data model. Our application allows user to register as actors and to perform CRUD operations on the films they played in or on the character they played.

## Setup for development

- Make sure you have `git` installed.
- Clone the repo on your local machine.

## Running the application

- Make sure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.
- Run the script `ProjectOne.sh` located in the root folder.
- The application is now running on `http://localhost:8080/AMTProjectOne/` and can be accessed easily.

## Connecting to the application

- Use a known actor ID or register to be connected to the application. For testing purpose, all password are set to `password` (but you can create an account using whatever password you want).
- When the credentials are correct, you can access the home page.
